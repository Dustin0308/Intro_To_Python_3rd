# Write a program named greeter.py that greets 'Victor' three times. Your program should use a 
# variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. Here's an example run of 
# the program:

# $ python greeter.py
# Good Morning, Victor.
# Good Afternoon, Victor.
# Good Evening, Victor.




# This answer can also be found in 'exercise_5.py.'

name = 'Victor'
print(f'Good morning, {name}.')
print(f'Good Afternoon, {name}.')
print(f'Good Evening, {name}.')
