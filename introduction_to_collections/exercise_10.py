# Bob expects the following code to print the names in alphabetical order. Without running the 
# code, can you say whether it will? Explain your answer.

names = { 'Chris', 'Clare', 'Karis', 'Karl',
          'Max', 'Nick', 'Victor' }
print(names)

# It likely won't because sets maintain an unordered collection of objects. His code could print them
# alphabetically on rare occasions, but they are still considered unordered to Python.
