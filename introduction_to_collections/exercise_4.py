# Why can we treat strings as sequences?


# It's important to note that strings are not collections but they act similar to collections. The
# individual characters in a string are not distinct objects or separate strings until you 
# reference a character in the string. The individual characters are not objects, but the
# characters can still be referenced through indedxing the same as sequences because they are
# ordered.
