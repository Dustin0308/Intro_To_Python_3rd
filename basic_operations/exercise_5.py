# Will an error occur if you try to access a list element with an index greater than or equal to the 
# list's length? For example:

foo = ['a', 'b', 'c']
print(foo[3])      # will this result in an error?



# Yes it will result in an Index Error due to it being out of range. Since there is only value for indexes 
# 0, 1, and 2, there is no index 3. So it will give an error.
