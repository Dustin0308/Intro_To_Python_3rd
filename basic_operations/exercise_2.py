# Used in REPL

# number = 4936
# ones = number % 10
# print(ones)
# Output: 6

# number = number // 10
# print(number)
# Output: 493

# tens = number % 10
# print(tens)
# Output: 3

# number = number // 10
# print(number)
# Output: 49

# hundreds = number % 10
# print(hundreds)
# Output: 9

# thousands = number // 10
# print(thousands)
