# Write a program named 'greeter.py'. The program should ask for your name, then output Hello, NAME! 
# where NAME is the name you entered:


# This can also be found in the program file 'exercise_1.py'.

# My Solution:

name = input('What is your name? ')

print(f'Hello, {name}!')


# Launch School's Solution:

name = input('What is your name? ')
print('Hello, ' + name + '!')


# And

name = input('What is your name? ')
print(f'Hello, {name}!')




# Exercise 2

# Modify the greeter.py program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, 
# then greet the user with their full name.

# This solution can also be found in the 'exercise_2.py' file.


# My solution:

first_name = input('What is your first name? ')
last_name = input('What is your last name? ')

print(f'Hello, {first_name} {last_name}!')



# Launch School's Solution:

first_name = input('What is your first name? ')
last_name = input('What is your last name? ')
print(f'Hello, {first_name} {last_name}!')
