# Identify at least 2 differences between lists and tuples. Identify at least 2 ways that lists and 
# tuples are similar.



# My Answer (matches Launch School's answer):

# Differences:

# 1: Lists are mutable, tuples are not immutable. 
# 2: Lists use '[]', tuples use '()'.

# Similarities:

# 1: Both are ordered collections which have a defined sequence.
# 2: Both are sequences.
# 3 (bonus in case # 2 isn't accepted): Both are heterogeneous, which means they can contain
#                                       different types of objects.




# Launch School's Answer: 

# Differences:

# Lists are mutable; tuples are immutable.
# List literals use []; tuple literals use ().

# Similarities:

# Lists and tuples are both sequences. Sequences are ordered collections that can use numeric indexes to access the members.
# Lists and tuples are heterogeneous; elements do not need to all be the same type.
